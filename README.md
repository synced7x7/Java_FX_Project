# Java FX Project

This repository is a personal learning archive showcasing various JavaFX projects completed to strengthen skills in Java, UI development, and application architecture. Each folder represents a different application or challenge encountered throughout this learning journey.

## Learning Journey

This collection reflects the ongoing progress and experimentation with JavaFX and related technologies. The focus has been on:
- Exploring fundamental and advanced JavaFX features.
- Understanding MVC architecture and modular application design.
- Gaining experience with database integration (MySQL 8.0).
- Improving UI development skills using FXML and CSS.
- Developing practical, small applications to solidify concepts and solve real-world problems.

##  Projects Showcase

###  Movie Browser Application

A visually-rich application for browsing a collection of movies. The app features a dark, modern theme and fetches all movie data from a local MySQL database.

**Key Features:**

  * **Main Gallery View**: Displays all movies in a clean, scrollable grid layout with movie posters and ratings.
  * **Detailed Movie View**: Clicking on a movie reveals a dedicated screen with a summary, genres, runtime, and high-quality character art.
  * **Dynamic Layouts**: The UI is designed to be responsive and visually engaging.
  * **Database Integration**: All movie information is stored and retrieved from a MySQL database using the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern.
  * **Watchlist**: Contains persistant watchlist options where users can catalog their favorite movies
